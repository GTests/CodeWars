# Codewars
Welcome to my collection of codewars katas! Here, you will find all solutions grouped by rank and programming language. Each puzzle was solved on official platform and verified against original test suites.

Codewars is a place where people can learn and practice programming. On this platform, users, often referred to as code warriors, take on programming challenges known as kata to improve their coding skills and earn recognition in the form of honor points. Each kata carries a rank known as kyū, indicating both its subject matter and level of complexity. These terms draw inspiration from the Japanese martial arts system, with Kyu (or Kyū) denoting the number of steps one is away from achieving mastery, often referred to as Dan level. 

Easiest level is 8kyu and hardest is 1kyu. The harder the kata, the more points you can earn. Everyone begins as an 8 kyū and can progress through the ranks.
